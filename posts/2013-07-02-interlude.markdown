It's been about 11 months since I've last posted to this blog. Or any other, for that matter.
How unfortunate.

I would love to have had a blog full of meaty posts of solid, well-informed opinions.
But I realise that whatever I write will fall short of that ideal; and what content there is falls short of that.
Also somewhat unfortunate.

So I'm writing this post to excuse myself of that responsibility. There are more useful ways to make use of this WordPress software than what I've been using.
I'm not a perfect writer (nor a perfect thinker), but I might as well log what I find to be worth logging, in whatever capacity that might be.
