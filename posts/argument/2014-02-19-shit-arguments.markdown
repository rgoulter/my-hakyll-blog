This came up on my newsfeed:

Those of you enamoured with the romance of "Oh, but the government is so shit" may enjoy it, I suppose.

I myself don't know much about economics.. but the above just seems a poor argument.  
It draws those it disagrees with as ugly and stupid, and those it agrees with as clever and attractive. - At best, if I, by the end, agree with what it says, will that be because I'm immature and stupid and easily swayed by pretty drawings, or because I've been enlightened by a good argument?  
But the "good argument" part here doesn't seem so good. Maybe if I were well informed of the arguments the above piece criticises I'd at least understand the terms better. The whole thing just seems a shambles. :/

Contrast instead with this. Yes, wealth is not equal. Worse than we think it is.  
But everyone agrees with that. Everyone, regardless of political belief and leaning.  
-- Interestingly, perhaps, there there is no "other", no evil-which-isn't-us.  
It's a much more genuine and convincing tone.. without being condescending or imbecile.
