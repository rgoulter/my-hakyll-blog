While using the _basics_ of Git (and other DVCSs) such as commit, push, pull or even merge are fairly straightforward to use,
there's a lot to Git which needs to be understood in case things go wrong while trying to do these things.  
I can't be alone in using Git without having a good understanding of what's going on (beyond the aforementioned 'basics').

\- A big "problem" (feature?) with Git is that it's very difficult to use without understanding how it works.
\- That's not as dumb a statement as it sounds. People can use web browsers with very little understanding of how the internet works, for example.

So here's a bunch of some resources which strike me as useful for those wanting to get better with their Git.

Online interactive demo's like [this one](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/), (which is cool, except the author likes using rebase a bit too much) are cool.  
[GitHub has its own 'code school'](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) which is similar. (At the time of writing, I've not tried it out).  
And [this page](http://www.wei-wang.com/ExplainGitWithD3/), while less fancy-lookin' than the previous two,
also features the same really cool interactive diagrams paired with a command line.
(As well, the author has given some examples which are probably common in various workflows).

Aside from offline interactive resources, [githug](https://github.com/Gazler/githug) is a game built for offline usage.
Again, I've not tried it yet, but given that it lacks the automatic 'pretty' visualisation which the above pages have,
it's going to feel much closer to "real-world" usage of Git.

In a same vein of 'git' and 'gamification' is [icefox's git-achievements](https://github.com/icefox/git-achievements),
which awards 'achievements' for making use of the various git commands. (e.g. [icefox's own page](http://icefox.github.io/git-achievements/)).

One brilliant, non-condescending discussion of Git I've read is "[Think Like a Git](http://think-like-a-git.net/epic.html)",
which takes an extremely "confused friendly" approach to explaining concepts which might not be clear.

And from some corner of my understanding, I do recall seeing this cute gif attached to the title
"[After reading the “Pro Git” book](http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/post/38296984861/after-reading-the-pro-git-book)":  
![](http://i.imgur.com/AgsGW.gif)

([Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) can be read "for free").

But to talk about "this book" or "that book", (or this or that article/blogpost) now devolves a bit into what's less-novel.

For a bit of fun, there's Steve Losh's [Git Koans](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2013/04/git-koans/).
