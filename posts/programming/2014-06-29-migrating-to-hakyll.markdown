So. I've taken the plunge and have started migrating to Hakyll.
Hakyll is a static site generator, written in Haskell.
Hakyll is like Jekyll, but not Ruby. (Well, I've not used Jekyll, so I can't easily, validly compare them).

Why Hakyll? Because Haskell. (Well, Hakyll as opposed to Jekyll).

Why a static site generator? 'cause it's cool. I like the idea of writing blogposts only in a markdown format, and
having that translated into a HTML markup.

This personal blog of mine is migrating from WordPress; I've made changes to the default Hakyll project to make it look more WordPress-y.
"Adapting" from various places: tags, categories, pagination and post "teasers".

It's still a bit rough at the edges. I'm not a great CSS / web designer. Clearly. And some of the blogposts from WordPress didn't quite
translate across correctly.
